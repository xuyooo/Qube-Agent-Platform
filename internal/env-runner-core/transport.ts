/**
 * The cp↔runner placement transport — the seam that lets one reconcile core

 *   - DbTransport   (built-in / same-cluster): reads/writes workspace_placements
 *                   directly over a pg pool.
 *   - HttpTransport (remote / BYOI): calls the /env/v1 protocol with an env
 *                   token; cp scopes every query to the token's environment.
 *
 * Both speak the same snake_case PlacementRow shape — which is exactly the JSON
 * the /env/v1/placements endpoint returns and the workspace_placements columns
 * the db transport selects — so the core never needs to know which side it talks
 * to.
