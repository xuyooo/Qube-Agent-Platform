 * Build the platform client to act as when serving a route.
 *
 * Every call a connector makes targets `route.workspace_id`, so it has to run
 * as the route owner rather than the connector owner: a shared connector whose
 * route points at another user's workspace gets scoped out to a 404
 * "Workspace not found" otherwise. When the owners match — the common case —
 * the connector's own client is reused so the hot path costs no extra token
 * lookup.
 *
 * Returns null when the route owner has no platform token. That is logged
 * here; callers should bail quietly.
