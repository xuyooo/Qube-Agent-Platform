/**
 * Interrupt the turn running in a chat thread, for the `/cancel` command.
 *
 * Connectors intercept `/cancel` before the job queue on purpose: inbound
 * messages are serialized behind the running turn, so a queued interrupt would
 * only arrive after the thing it meant to stop had finished. Going straight to
 * cp reaches the turn that is actually in flight. The user's follow-up then
 * resumes the same session with its history — cancel exists so a wrong host or
 * a missing detail can be corrected without starting over, and whatever the
 * interrupted turn had produced is discarded, which is the point.
 *
 * Returns the text to acknowledge with — each connector delivers it its own
 * way — or null when the route owner has no platform token, in which case the
 * caller should bail quietly (already logged).
