 *
 * Shared by the `POST /:id/start` route and auto-start (`ensureWorkspaceRunning`).
 * Does NOT wait for readiness — the start route lets the reconcile watch flip
 * status to `running`, while auto-start polls the agent `/health` endpoint.
 *
 * Forces a pod rebuild (not just a drift-gated one) whenever the workspace has
 * no live token, or its recorded status isn't already `running`.
 * `setDesiredPhase` revokes every token of a workspace the instant it leaves
 * `running` (placement.ts), but the env-runner's actual scale-down is
 * asynchronous — the physical pod holding that now-revoked token can still be
 * alive when desired_phase flips back to running moments later (the same
 * stop+start race POST /:id/restart's own doc calls out, reachable here too via
 * idle-GC stopping a workspace and an auto-start racing right behind it). Plain
 * drift detection can't see this — the pod spec never changed, only its token
 * did — so force it rather than trust drift.reasons.
 *
 * The token check is what actually closes that race, and the status check alone
 * did not: `workspaces.status` is written by the reconcile watch, so a stop that
 * has revoked the tokens but not yet flipped the recorded status leaves a start
 * looking at `running` and skipping the rebuild. The pod then stays up for as
 * long as nothing else rebuilds it, holding a token cp rejects — its model
 * turns keep working (those never reach cp) while every call that does reach cp
 * 401s: config and credential fetches, the MCP OAuth proxy, memory refresh.
 * Failures that quiet, in a workspace that looks healthy, are what make this
 * worth a redundant rebuild on the rare false positive.
